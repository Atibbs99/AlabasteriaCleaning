  <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1>

  <p>
    At Alabasteria Cleaning Services, we know that maintaining a clean building isn’t just about appearances — it’s about protecting your business.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re a <strong>family-owned company</strong> that takes every job seriously because we know what it’s like to build something from the ground up.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’ve cleaned offices, schools, and worked with large organizations like the YMCA and local car dealerships — places that demand strict attention to detail, fast-paced cleaning, and total trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Why businesses choose us:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cleaner spaces mean fewer accidents.</strong> A well-maintained facility helps reduce slip and fall risks — protecting your people and your bottom line.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthier environments mean fewer sick days.</strong> Regular disinfecting keeps viruses at bay, so your staff stays healthier and your operations keep moving.</li>
    <li><strong>A clean building reflects professionalism.</strong> Clients, customers, and employees notice — and it shows you care about your business.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean buildings cost less to maintain.</strong> Dirt and buildup can wear down surfaces fast — we help prevent costly repairs with consistent care.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We don’t cut corners — we clean them. And because we’re a family business, you’ll never feel like just another account. We’re reliable, flexible, and genuinely care about your space.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want a cleaning team that’s experienced, trustworthy, and invested in your facility’s quality — we’re here for you, so you can focus on what you do best and leave the cleaning to us.
  </p>

  <p class="slogan">
    <strong>“Because clean should never be a question.”</strong>
