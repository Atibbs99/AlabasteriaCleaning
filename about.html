  <h1>Our Vision</h1>
  <p>
    At Alabasteria, our vision is to set the standard for reliable, consistent, and thoughtful commercial cleaning.
    We are committed to delivering dependable, high-quality service that not only meets but exceeds expectations —
    all while staying grounded in our family values, honesty, and care. We believe clean spaces help businesses thrive,
    and we’re proud to be a part of that mission.
  </p>

  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Alabasteria Cleaning Services was founded in 2024 as a family-run business with deep roots in the cleaning industry.
    Our story began with our mother, who spent over a decade working in commercial and residential cleaning.
    Growing up, I often watched her work long hours with dedication and integrity.
    When she shared her dream of starting a business of her own, I was proud to step in and help bring that vision to life
    — especially when it came to navigating the challenges of launching a company in today’s digital world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting Alabasteria wasn’t easy. Like many small family businesses, we faced financial struggles and went through
    a long period without seeing any profits. There were moments when we questioned whether we’d make it. But what kept us
    going was our belief in the value of honest work, and our commitment to every client, big or small. Today, we are still
    growing — step by step — and staying true to the principles that got us here: care, consistency, and service that speaks for itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether we’re cleaning an office, a school, or a retail space, our goal is the same: to create a cleaner, healthier,
    and more welcoming environment for the people who use it every day.
  </p>

    <p>
      As the founder and director of Alabasteria Cleaning Services, I believe that care is just as important as consistency.
      I’ve always believed that a clean space isn’t just about making things look nice — it’s about creating a safe, healthy,
      and productive environment where people feel respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started this company alongside my family, inspired by my mom’s more than 10 years of experience in the cleaning industry.
      From the very beginning, I’ve been involved in every part of the business — from scheduling and operations to hands-on training
      — to make sure we deliver the kind of service I would want for my own community.
    </p>
    <p>
      My promise to you is simple: we’ll treat your space like it matters — because it does. We’ll listen, adapt, and always
      show up ready to give you our best.
